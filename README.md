# List of Generic Items

In this project, users have the capability to add, modify, and delete items in the list, as well as apply filters and sort the list.

## Website

This project is hosted on Vercel.
Open [https://list-ta.vercel.app/](https://list-ta.vercel.app/) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

This project utilizes a mock API service provided by Typicode. It's important to note that any modifications made to the list of items through API calls are not persisted between calls. That leads to unexpected server behaviour in a few scenarios.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
